# Changelog

All notable changes to ClipForge. The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and versions follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [1.0.0] - 2026-10-24

The first public release: everything below, plus a one-click installer and self-updates.

### Added
- **One-click install.** Windows: `install.bat`, or the standalone `ClipForge-Setup.bat` from the
  release, which downloads ClipForge first. macOS: `install.sh`. The installer lists what it will set
  up (Python, FFmpeg, Git, Deno, Ollama, Python packages, AI models), asks once, reuses what is
  already installed, and shows messages in Turkish or English.
- **Desktop shortcut and Start menu entry** (Windows) or `ClipForge.command` + `ClipForge.app` (macOS)
  with the new icon. They open ClipForge in the browser, reuse an already running ClipForge, and pick a
  free port if 8000 is taken (`cli.py launch`).
- **Uninstaller** (Windows: Apps & features or `installer\windows\uninstall.bat`; macOS:
  `installer/macos/uninstall.sh`). It asks before deleting projects, settings or AI models.
- **Settings → Updates**: checks GitHub for a new version and installs it (`git pull` + new packages),
  then ClipForge restarts by itself.
- `cli.py doctor --download-models` fetches the Whisper model during setup instead of on the first
  transcription.
- New app icon (gold diamond on navy) as `.ico`, `.icns`, `.png` and favicon, also used in the header.
- README with screenshots in dark and light theme and a demo GIF; detailed reference in
  `docs/how-it-works.md`.
- Tests (pytest), lint (ruff), GitHub Actions CI (backend on Windows + Linux, frontend type check,
  translations check and build, installer script checks), issue templates.

### Earlier milestones (before 1.0.0, unreleased)
- **Batch queue, best-of video, calibration**: one render job per clip with reorder / retry / cancel,
  the queue survives restarts, optional shutdown when done; 16:9 best-of videos with title cards,
  crossfades, loudness normalization and AI chapters; channel calibration from real YouTube views;
  Fast analysis with the smaller model.
- **Natural AI titles**: few-shot examples per language, glossary, proofreading pass, offline
  dictionary check, Turkish vowel harmony fixes, thumbs up/down that teach your style.
- **Chat signal + local LLM** (Ollama, Qwen 3.5): chat replay from YouTube / Twitch / log files, viral
  score, refined cuts, titles, hashtags, hook text, cover prompt, subtitle translation.
- **Web UI + 9:16 rendering**: library, project review with Hype Map and live 9:16 preview, facecam
  detection and editor, burned-in word-timed subtitles (incl. right-to-left Arabic), 7 UI languages,
  dark/light theme, LAN mode.
- **Highlight engine**: loudness, keywords, laughter/shouting, speech rhythm, music signals combined
  into a hype curve with word-snapped, non-overlapping clip candidates.
- **Foundations**: hardware detection, `doctor` with a real GPU smoke test and automatic fixes,
  ingest from URL or file, resumable multilingual transcription with word timestamps.

# Exam week log

Autonomous work session started 2026-10-27 (base version 1.2.5). Every decision and open question
is written down here so it can be reviewed later. Nothing was published; the repo stays private.

Ground rules followed: headless browser only, no Whisper/LLM/render runs on real videos, no GPU
stress, one commit per task, one version bump at the end.

## Task 1: public release readiness

**Sweep** (`git grep` over everything except `frontend/dist` and the lockfile, plus the full git
history for keys/tokens):

- No secrets, API keys, OAuth client files, tokens or local paths in the tree or in the history.
- No `TODO` / `FIXME` / `console.log` / `breakpoint()` / stray `print()` in the app code.
- Your full name was used as test data in `backend/tests/test_welcome.py` (channel-name hashtag
  test). Replaced with a made-up channel name.
- `welcome.py` mentioned "Claude Code" in a docstring; made it neutral ("a development session").
- The GitHub user name `utkualsir` only appears in repo URLs (README, installers, updater, bundle
  id `io.github.utkualsir.sharkyclips`). That is expected for a public repo, so it stays.
- "Measured on an RTX 5070 Laptop" in README / how-it-works is a benchmark statement, not a
  hardcoded setting. Kept, but phrased as "a mid-range laptop GPU (RTX 5070 Laptop, 8 GB)".
- Screenshots and the demo GIF only show your own Delta Force project (unchanged).

**Docs fixes:**

- README said "Nothing is uploaded" and the FAQ said "SharkyClips never uploads anything", which
  contradicts the optional YouTube upload. Rewritten (English and Turkish) to: nothing leaves the
  PC unless *you* press Upload, and then only to your own YouTube channel.
- New `CONTRIBUTING.md` (setup, checks, project rules like the VERSION file and the 7 locales,
  no console windows) and `SECURITY.md` (how to report, what the LAN mode exposes).
  README's Contributing section now points to it.

**Open questions for you:**

- **Commit author email.** All 19 commits are authored as `utkualsir <utkualsir@gmail.com>`. When
  the repo goes public, that address is visible in the history. Rewriting history is destructive,
  so I didn't. If you mind: set `git config user.email <id>+utkualsir@users.noreply.github.com`
  for future commits, and decide yourself whether to rewrite old ones before going public.
- `CLAUDE.md` is committed and mentions the dev PC's GPU. Harmless, but you may want to keep it
  out of the public repo (or keep it: it doubles as contributor notes).
- The UI still stores the theme / language in `localStorage` keys `cf-theme` / `cf-lang` (old
  ClipForge prefix). Renaming them would reset every user's choice, so they stay.
